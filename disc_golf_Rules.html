                <h2>How to Play Disc Golf</h2>
                <p>
                    Disc golf is played much like traditional golf, but instead of hitting a ball into a hole, 
                    players throw a flying disc (Frisbee) into a metal basket with hanging chains. The goal is 
                    to complete each hole in the fewest number of throws.
                </p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    Finish the course (typically 9 or 18 holes) with the lowest total number of throws, just like golf.
                </p>

                <div class="rule-item">
                    <h3>1. Starting the Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each player begins at the tee area.<br>
                        The order of play is decided randomly for the first hole; afterward, the player with 
                        the lowest score on the previous hole tees off first.
                    </p>

                <div class="rule-item">
                    <h3>2. Throwing the Disc</h3>
                    <p>
                        After the first throw, the player whose disc is farthest from the basket throws next.<br>
                        Throws are made from the spot where the previous throw landed.<br>
                        The disc must be thrown, not handed or kicked.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="rule-item">
                    <h3>3. Tee Throws</h3>
                    <p>
                        Must be made from within the designated tee area.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>4. Fairway Throws</h3>
                    <p>
                        The player's foot must be directly behind the disc's lie (the spot where it landed).<br>
                        You may not step past the lie until after the disc is released.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Putting</h3>
                    <p>
                        A putt is any throw made within 10 meters (33 feet) of the basket.<br>
                        The player must maintain balance—no stepping past the lie—until the disc comes to rest.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. Completion of a Hole</h3>
                    <p>
                        A hole is completed when the disc comes to rest in the basket or chains.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. Out of Bounds (OB)</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a disc lands out of bounds, a one-throw penalty is added.<br>
                        The next throw is made from where the disc last crossed in bounds.

                    <p>
                        Each throw counts as one stroke.<br>
                        Lowest total strokes after all holes wins.

                    <h3>Start with Fewer Discs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beginners should start with just 2-3 discs: a driver, a mid-range, and a putter.

                        Good form is more important than power. Practice your throwing technique before trying to throw hard.
