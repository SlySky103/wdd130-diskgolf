    <h1>Skylers's Personal Client Report:</h1>

    <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</p>
    <p>Well originally I had the idea of making the website about everything that we learned over the semester, which felt like a very orignal idea at the time, but overall the images that I came up with just were ideas that came to me as I developed my site plan and to keep the images tied to what the site plan was going to be about basically.</p>

    <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</p>
    <p>I had quite a difficult time being creative with my siteplan, and trying to understand how I should build one just from scratch even though we've done that before in class, although I feel like we had a bit of a planned outline before, but for this one it had to all come from me, and so that's where I felt like I struggled tremendously and had a terrible time trying to finish that up so that my other team members could start to work on the whole site entirely, so basically the only issues were the ones that I had with myself and getting my site plan to my own lead developer.</p>

    <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</p>
    <p>I would say for the most part yes, looking back on it I wished I picked a different color pallet while now realixing what it looks like currently, but I think that my lead developer did an amazing job at her work for the website.</p>

    <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</p>
    <p>I honestly, probably won't ever hire anybody to do something like this for me, especially if it's a personal thing, but if I had to I would absoulutely make sure that it is a more trusted source and that they wouldn't get anything particularly wrong here and there, and I would like constant updates, like more frequently reminded of what the webpage looks like from the delevopers perspective.</p>


    <h1>Skyler's Personal Lead Developer Report:</h1>

    <p>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</p>
    <p>I didn't really have anything to talk about to my junior developers since I hadn't recieved a site plan from our client the entire time and so when they did come to me to ask questions about it I just told them that I didn't get a site plan to work on yet either and that I'll try and figure something out for them, but luckily we had the discgolf site plan as an example to work through and they still did pretty good on that as well regardless.</p>

    <p>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</p>
    <p>I don't think I ever recieved any actual communication from my client the entire time, which I found to be a real issue because it was putting so much unnecessary stress onto myself since the entire issue was out of my hands and I hated having that feeling looming over me the whole time, while others also relied on what work I had to finish up in the mean time as well, with not only my site plan but also a faint idea of what to give to my junior developers, basically just things like that were huge roadblockers for me.</p>

    <p>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</p>
    <p>Well, I basically started back over from scratch once I got the new site plan which was the discgolf site plan and I created a new repository and then shared that with my junior developers so that they could also get to view the site plan and the web pages that we were going to be working on and walking through as we developed them, which in that case turned out pretty well but it was still a headache in itself to get to that point.</p>

    <p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</p>
    <p>GitHub isn't too confusing once you get the hang of it but I can see why it would be at the very start when we first started using it and had to have a walk through of it at first, that's why I feel like having some sort of way to introduce it way earlier in the course would be a good idea if possible.</p>


    <h1>Skyler's Personal Junior Developer Report:</h1>

    <p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</p>
    <p>I think I had hardly any interactions with them since I was working so hard on the lead development side and the client side of this project, and then when it came down to being a junior developer I just sat down and followed what was already in place by the other two developers and expanded upon what I was suppossed to be inputting on the website.</p>

    <p>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</p>
    <p>Most definitely, it only took me a little while to realize what sub page of the site was mine to work on and then once I did I knocked out both of them for both my lead development jobs all in one night, the junior development side of the project might be the easiest but I wouldn't mind cutting down on it a bit to where there'd only be one site to work on a sub page rather than two sites, or maybe cut the whole junior developer side entirely, but that's just my opinion on it.</p>

    <p>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</p>
    <p>Yes, absolutely, and I didn't need to seek outside help from the other developers on it either, I just sat down and focused and did the work on it until I finished everything for it.</p>

    <p>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</p>
    <p>No, not really, although it was a little bit confusing to figure out that some index html's code didn't line up exactly with the ones in the GitHub, so I had to manually copy and paste new ones with different names and such, all so that they could match up together and link up.</p>


    <h1>General Experience and Reflection</h1>
    <p>Skyler's personal experience and preferences on this final project:</p>

    <p>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</p>
    <p>The most challenging, difficult, problematic part of this project was having to wait upon other peoples inputs or have the unsettling feeling about how other people are waiting on you to figure out what to do next, it was just super stressful for about 3 weeks, and I really didn't enjoy that feeling of that overall, some parts though I do understand were coming from my own doing yes, and I could've fixed that sooner, but the parts that were out of my hands and I was just twiddling my thumbs basically, that's what felt like the worst in terms of this final project assignment.</p>

    <p>What did you enjoy most about this project?</p>
    <p>I think I enjoyed getting to see everyone's websites come to life, and the efforts put behind them because you could really tell who knew exactly how to figure out what the people wanted, which were the clients, and the developers also knew how to compromise and let the clients know if they thought something else would look better on it, and the clients also did the same, basically I think I liked the communication and the final product, but I wish for my sake there was more of all of that since I felt like my time on the project was severely laking that entirely.</p>

    <p>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</p>
    <p>I would definitely change a lot of things about this assignment, but the main thing would have to be how the entire thing is set up, and I feel like I've been brutally honest or very blunt this whole time, but I really did not like the whole teamwork side of the project, especially when we didn't even have a peoples page on our moduels for canvas to have an easy way to get in touch with someone from our project, and I'm not blaming anyone for the way that the final project was set up since I do love the faculty here at the campus, I just want to show my views on it and what I wished it was instead and to share how it should be completely different, and probably shifted to an individual project rather than a team one, since there are way to many variables that could go awry and if you're missing just one out of everything then the whole system could be in disarry basically, that's how I viewed it at least.</p>

    <p>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</p>
    <p>Overall I would say that I do, since I know now what to avoid or what I do or don't like from a team commited project at least in the programming world, but on the other hand I would say that I don't since the assignment felt very clunky since if one person was out of the loop then it felt like everything fell apart, at least that's how it felt to me, and that's what makes me discouraged for what real life programming team effort projects would be like.</p>
