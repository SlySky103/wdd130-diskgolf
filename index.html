            <h2>Welcome to BYUI Disc Golf</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite spots in Rexburg is the disc golf course right on the BYU–Idaho campus. It's a 9-hole course that's perfect for beginners and amateurs—it's fun, approachable, and still offers enough challenge to keep every round interesting. The layout makes great use of the campus scenery, so it's not just a good workout but also a really enjoyable way to spend time outdoors with friends or unwind between classes. Whether you're new to disc golf or just looking to sharpen your skills, it's the perfect place to play.</p>
